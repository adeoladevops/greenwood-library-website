Collaborating between developers Morgan and Jamie
Steps used to achieve this project
**Steps**
Created a new repository named "greenwood-library-website" and initialized it with a README.md
Cloned the repo onto my local machine and created empty files about_us.html, contact_us.html, events.html, and home.html
Filled the empty files with contents.
Pushed to origin main.
Created a new branch for book_reviews and pushed it to the origin main.
Created pull requests to resolve issues before merging.
Merged branch with main since no conflict was encountered and deleted the branch created for Morgan to update book reviews.
Created a new branch to update Jamie's work on the event.html file.
Pull from the main to Jamie's branch.
Updated event.html and pushed to origin main.
Created a pull request to merge Jamie's work with the main.
Merged with the main and deleted the Jamie branch after completion.
